This project was done as a part of Machine Learning Course

We are using the Elliptic Data Set (https://www.kaggle.com/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set) and working to improve on the orignals results by Weber, Mark, et al. "Anti-money laundering in bitcoin: Experimenting with graph convolutional networks for financial forensics." arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.02591 (2019).

We use ML models such as SVM and Random Forest. We use oversampling techiques such as SMOTE, ctCAN and GMM. Also, we generated node embeddings using DeepWalk and trained ML models on them.
